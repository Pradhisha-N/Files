Ansible is a open-source It engine that automates application deployment,cloud provisioning, intra service orchestration, and other IT tools.

Ansible pushes modules to the clients and these modules are locally executed on the client side and the output is pushed back to the ansible server.

Ansible is designed for multitier deployment. ansible is agentless which means it workes by connecting nodes through SSH.

In ansible, the management nodes is a controlling node that controls the entire execution of the playbook.

The inventry file provides the list of hosts where ansible modules need to be run.
The management nodes makes an SSH connection and executes the small modules on the host's machine and installs the software.
These modules are removed once the task is completed.
